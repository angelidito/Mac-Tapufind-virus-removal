# Tapufind Mac Removal
This script try to fully remove Tapufind.

These are the **known** folders where tapufind can be found and from files will be removed:
- /Users/$USER/Library/LaunchAgents
- /Users/Shared (work in progress...)

Also, this folder, witch contains Safari cache, will be removed after user confirmation:
/Library/Cahes/com.apple.Safari


I might have been infected via torrent downloading so you know... Watch out.

If you got infected I would be pleased if you could tell me where you found tapu files at and also their names.
I am specially interested in /Users/Shared folder, because I am almost sure that tapu creates several kind of files different names, but with a same pattern.

You can find me as @angelidito almost everywhere.
